## Here is a 2D Top-Down game project under development, in the Dark Souls Like genre.

## Little Dark Age

🌑 Little Dark Age
Survival in a world where every step can be the last

Immerse yourself in a dark 2D universe where fear reigns and resources are worth their weight in gold. You will have to fight with fierce enemies, explore dangerous locations and make difficult decisions — because every mistake can lead to death.

Game Features:
Hardcore gameplay — limited supplies, permanent death, and enemies who don't give you any favors.
Oppressive atmosphere — gloomy style, disturbing soundtrack and a world full of secrets.
Difficult battles — tactics are more important than strength, learn to read opponents or you will die.
Unexpected threats — traps, invisible enemies and events that will test your endurance.

Do you dare to challenge the darkness?
